    <h2>Who I Am</h2>
    <p>
        I am <strong>Shoghi Lin</strong> (known officially as Lin Boyu in Japan), a Cloud Infrastructure Engineer currently based in Tokyo. 
        I hold a Master's degree in AI from <strong>Waseda University</strong>, where I focused on the intersection of machine learning and system architecture.
    </p>

    <h2>Professional Focus</h2>
    <p>
        My daily work involves architecting and maintaining scalable cloud environments on <strong>AWS</strong>, specifically leveraging <strong>EKS (Kubernetes)</strong>, <strong>CDK</strong>, and <strong>Lambda</strong> for automated operations. 
        Currently, I am heavily involved in providing technical support and implementation for <strong>Dify</strong>, helping organizations bridge the gap between LLM research and production-grade applications.
    </p>

    <h2>Technical Roadmap</h2>
    <p>
        I am a strong believer in continuous learning. My current focus is on mastering the AWS ecosystem, with a roadmap including SAA, DevOps Professional, and ultimately the <strong>Solutions Architect Professional (SAP)</strong> certification. 
        Through this blog, I document my journey in Cloud Engineering and AI implementation, sharing insights on cost optimization and infrastructure-as-code.
    </p>

    <h2>Beyond the Code</h2>
    <p>
        One of the main reasons I chose to live in Japan is the vibrant music scene. When I'm not debugging EKS clusters or experimenting with new LLM prompts, you'll likely find me at a live <strong>concert</strong>. 
        I am also a student of music myself, taking regular <strong>singing lessons</strong> to explore the technicalities of the human voice.
